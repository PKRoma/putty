Information about PuTTY for the Mac OS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Compiling it:

 See ../README for generic information.

 To compile PuTTY for Mac OS you will need:

 MPW
  <ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./
   MPW-GM_Images/MPW-GM.img.bin>

 Universal Headers (optional)
  <ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/
   UniversalHeaders3.4.2.img.bin>

 Text Encoding Converter SDK
  <ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/TEC_1.5.sit.hqx>

 Install MPW, install the new Universal Headers (optional), then put
 the contents of the "68K Static Libraries" directory of the Text
 Encoding Converter SDK into "Interfaces&Libraries:Libraries:Libraries".

 The "mkputty.mpw" script does most of the work, but currently needs
 you to run "Rez -append -o PuTTY mac_res.r {Includes}" to get the
 resources compiled in.  The Makefile currently only generates a
 Classic 68K application.  Other architectures will come later.

Runtime requirements:

 PuTTY should run on any Macintosh running System 7.0 or later.  The
 Classic 68K build seems not to run under Mac OS X (even with
 Classic.app).

Known bugs:

 * PowerPC and fat versions fail to start on systems without AppearanceLib (ie
   most System 7 ones).  The 68k version works fine. [MAYBE FIXED]
 * Display is far too slow.
 * Real bold doesn't compensate for changing character widths without Color
   QuickDraw. [MAYBE FIXED]
 * sshsha.c and sshmd5.c cause a stack overflow in Apple's PowerPC C compiler 
   unless optimisation is entirely disabled.

Features we need (and aren't entirely obvious):

 * Scroll-conflation -- scroll_display should change the in-memory
   display and remember the scroll, then do_scroll should be called
   only when scroll_display gets called for a different rectangle or
   term_paint happens.
