This is the README for PuTTY, a free Win32 Telnet and SSH client.

The provided Makefile is for MS Visual C++ systems. Type `nmake' to
build both putty.exe (the main program) and pscp.exe (an SCP
client).

Setting up a project file in the Visual C++ IDE sometimes fails to
work. In particular, Visual Studio 6 falls over on the odd macro
usage in ssh.c. This is a bug in Visual Studio, since the VC++6
command line compiler works fine. If in doubt, just use `nmake'.

Bug reports and feature requests should be sent to
<putty-bugs@lists.tartarus.org>. PLEASE read the section on the web
site about how to report bugs effectively. Do NOT send one-line
reports saying `it doesn't work'!
