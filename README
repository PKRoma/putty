This is the README for the source archive of PuTTY, a free Win32
Telnet and SSH client.

If you want to rebuild PuTTY from source, we provide a variety of
Makefiles and equivalents:

 - Makefile.vc is for command-line builds on MS Visual C++ systems.
   Type `nmake -f Makefile.vc' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

   (We've also had one report of success building with the
   OpenWatcom compiler -- www.openwatcom.org -- using Makefile.vc
   with `wmake -ms -f makefile.vc' and NO_MULTIMON, although we
   haven't tried this ourselves.)

 - Inside the MSVC subdirectory are MS Visual Studio project files
   for doing GUI-based builds of the various PuTTY utilities. These
   have been tested on Visual Studio 6.

   You should be able to build each PuTTY utility by loading the
   corresponding .dsp file in Visual Studio. For example,
   MSVC/putty/putty.dsp builds PuTTY itself, MSVC/plink/plink.dsp
   builds Plink, and so on.

 - Makefile.bor is for the Borland C compiler. Type `make -f
   Makefile.bor' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

 - Makefile.cyg is for Cygwin / mingw32 installations. Type `make -f
   Makefile.cyg' to build all the PuTTY binaries. Note that by
   default the Pageant WinNT security features and the multiple
   monitor support are excluded from the Cygwin build, since at the
   time of writing this Cygwin doesn't include the necessary
   headers.

 - Makefile.lcc is for lcc-win32. Type `make -f Makefile.lcc'. (You
   will probably need to specify COMPAT=-DNO_MULTIMON.)

All of the Makefiles are generated automatically from the file
`Recipe' by the Perl script `mkfiles.pl'. Additions and corrections
to Recipe and the mkfiles.pl are much more useful than additions and
corrections to the alternative Makefiles themselves.

If you want to send bug reports or feature requests, please read the
Feedback section of the web site before doing so. Sending one-line
reports saying `it doesn't work' will waste your time as much as
ours.
