This is the README for PuTTY, a free Win32 Telnet and SSH client.

The provided Makefile is for MS Visual C++ systems. Type `nmake' to
build both putty.exe (the main program) and pscp.exe (an SCP
client). The comment at the top of the Makefile gives extra build
options you can use to build in limited Win32s compatibility, a hack
to pass SSH through some types of firewall, and `official' version
numbers.

MS Visual Studio version 6 falls over on the nasty macros in ssh.c.
This is a bug in Visual Studio. The culprit is the /ZI compiler
option (debug info generation: Edit and Continue). To avoid this
problem while compiling PuTTY under VS6, you should:
 - right-click ssh.c in the FileView
 - click Settings
 - select the C/C++ tab and the General category
 - under `Debug info:', select anything _other_ than `Program
   Database for Edit and Continue'.
Alternatively disable the /ZI option, replacing it with a saner
value, such as /Zi.

For other compilers, some alternative Makefiles are provided. These
Makefiles are generated automatically from the master `Makefile' by
the Perl script `mkfiles.pl'. Additions and corrections to the
script are more useful than additions and corrections to the
alternative Makefiles themselves.
